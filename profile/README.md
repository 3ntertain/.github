## Our Approach
We are on the journey to build a 100% decentralized and democratic app, governed by a protocol and it's users. We travel one step at a timen focusing on user experience and reducing the time to market. In it's current state, 3ntertain is a 2.5 app, combining the power of the Solana blockchain with the ease and speed of the best web2 technologies.

## Our next steps
### Decentralized reward distribution
We are studying [Merkle Distributor](https://github.com/pngfi/merkle-distributor) from [Penguin Finance](https://github.com/pngfi) to handle the rewards distribution with full transparency.

### Decentralized tournament creation
We are bullish on [Raindrops](https://docs.raindrops.xyz/), it will help us to imrpove 3ntertain.

### xNFTs
xNFTs x 3ntertain is a match made in heaven. 3ntertain is the perfect use case for programmable NFTs.
