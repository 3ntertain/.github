## Our Approach
We are on the journey to build a 100% decentralized and democratic app, governed by a protocol and it's users. We travel one step at a timen focusing on user experience and reducing the time to market. In it's current state, 3ntertain is a 2.5 app, combining the power of the Solana blockchain with the ease and speed of the best web2 technologies.
